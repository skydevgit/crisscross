VERSION 0.5.1
    * Fixed Makefiles to work on any previously non-working platforms (OS X, mainly).
    * Disabled CPUID on BSD. BSD lacks affinity control, and therefore doesn't work.

VERSION 0.5.0 ( MILESTONE 2, Codename "Loki" )
    * Cleanup
		Much of the existing code was disorganized, and was re-categorized into other namespaces.
    * Documentation
          o All namespaces
          o Stopwatch class
          o LList class
          o RedBlackTree class
		Some classes that showed up in documentation are now hidden.
          o CrissCross::System::param
          o CrissCross::Data::LListItem< T >
          o CrissCross::Data::RedBlackTree< dataType, keyType >::nodeType
    * Conventionalization
		Existing code is now consistent in it's conventions.
    * Bugfixes
		Bugs discovered during the v0.4.x testing cycle have been corrected (details unnecessary for pre-release code).
    * Examples
		v0.5.0 is the first public release. Examples are now provided for reference.
    * Cross-Platform Fixes
		Functions in CoreConsole that previously did nothing on non-Windows platforms now do what they should.
    * UTF-8 Support ( partially implemented and is untested)
		WCHAR and so on need to be supported. We're working on this right now, so please don't #define ENABLE_UNICODE unless you're brave.
